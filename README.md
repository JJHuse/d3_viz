I started these projects for the Data and Information Visualization course at Yale. The quesadilla visualization was a final project, drawing upon principles and techniques I learned during the semester. The data came from my New Years resolution in 2021, to have a different quesadilla every day. I recorded pictures and some notes for most of those days, and I transferred the information to the csv in this repo.
